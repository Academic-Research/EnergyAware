Performed several simulations of eddies of 4 different lenghts and analysed the effort of the \AUV on trying to got straight ahead in a period of 500 s.
###### Contribution
Measured the impact of different sizes of eddies relative do the AUV size. 
They concluded that eddies lenght scales similar to the AUV lenght scale cause more energy consuption than eddies hundreds bigger than the AUV size.
###### Comparison
In comparison to our approach they do not applied any solution to the problem they only measured and identified the problem.

In addition to exclusion zones and obstacles Carroll \etal~\cite{Carroll92AUV} present a path planner based on bathymetry and ocean current using A* search.
The path planner keeps track of fuel resources and mission time for each proposed path segment and does the choice based on a expectation of remaining resources level combined with other requirements (i.e. user desired speed, underwater corridors known, and goal position).
###### Contribution
For each node expansion in the A* search the cost of the travel is computed considering AUV speed, fuel and corridor lenght.

Niu \etal~\cite{Niu2018Energy} present an energy efficient path planning for USVs considering sea current data;
They use a combination of Voronoi diagram, Visibility Graph, Dijkstra search and energy consuption function for determination of the path.
The Voronoi-Visibility energy-aware path planner were analysed through software simulation and compared to fifteen real mission considering mission time, \USV speed and sea current.

\USV energy-aware path planning studies are based on the fact that sea current imply higher level of energy cost on trnaspacing such waters.
Usually, for USV, there is a limited energy and saving energy allow more complex and demanding missions.
