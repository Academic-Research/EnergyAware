A wrong estimation may lead to unexpected crashes, while a too simplistic one may underuse the full potential of the battery, decreasing the task performance.

Usually, for \USV, there is a limited energy and saving energy allow more complex and demanding missions.
\USV energy-aware path planning studies usually are based on the fact that sea current imply higher level of energy cost on trnaspacing such waters.
For example, in Niu \etal~\cite{Niu2018Energy} they present an energy efficient path planning for USVs considering sea current data;
They use a combination of Voronoi diagram, Visibility Graph, Dijkstra search and energy consuption function for determination of the path.
For each Voronoi segment its determined a energy consumption weight calculated based on \USV relative speed, the sea current speed, the drag force the \USV experiences, and the travel duration.
The predicted sea current speed is based on samples of the Tidetech Ltd, 2016. " Tidetech Ltd, Currents sample [Online]. https://www.tidetech.org/data. (Accessed 12 December 2016)".
They present simulations of \USV path planning in the Singapore Strait and Croatian islands and compare the simulation results to fifteen real-world trial on the same regions.
Comparisons between the energy-aware path in comparison to the shortest path indicate increase on energy saving between 1.27% and 52.84%. 
More energy saving was found on situation with favourable sea current direction and low speed.

Franco and Buttazo \cite{Franco2016Coverage} present an energy model for determination of the energy cost of the path traveled by a \UAV when covering the area using the back-and-forth pattern.
They determine the cost of a path considering basic measurable maneuvers, i.e., climb/descend, accelerate/decelerate, fly at constant speed, and rotate.
The path planning is based on an energy model defined from the power consumption measured for each operation.
See equation 6.
Based on the equation 6 the authors propose the computation of the integral of the energy cost related to a distance d, in order to find the optimal speed that minimizes the energy necessary to travel the d portion of the path.
Their model considers that the \UAV starts from zero speed, reaches and keeps a constant speed, and then decelerates until zero before the turning maneuver at the end of each straight line.

In Cabreira et al. \cite{Cabreira2018Energy} they expand the energy model presented by Franco and Buttazo considering spiral cover patterns.
The energy-aware spiral algorithm determines a set of waypoints and vertices that generate polygonal paths.
The path planning algorithm contains the same energy model present in Franco and Buttazo to set different optimal speeds when flying in straight segments of the path.
Also, Cabreira et al. improve the model considering decelerations different from 0 during turn in a spiral path.
Moreover, adapted the optimal speed determination through integral adding acceleration and deceleration functions to the integral.
