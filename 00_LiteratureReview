Performed several simulations of eddies of 4 different lenghts and analysed the effort of the \AUV on trying to got straight ahead in a period of 500 s.
###### Contribution
Measured the impact of different sizes of eddies relative do the AUV size. 
They concluded that eddies lenght scales similar to the AUV lenght scale cause more energy consuption than eddies hundreds bigger than the AUV size.
###### Comparison
In comparison to our approach they do not applied any solution to the problem they only measured and identified the problem.

In addition to exclusion zones and obstacles Carroll \etal~\cite{Carroll92AUV} present a path planner based on bathymetry and ocean current using A* search.
The path planner keeps track of fuel resources and mission time for each proposed path segment and does the choice based on a expectation of remaining resources level combined with other requirements (i.e. user desired speed, underwater corridors known, and goal position).
###### Contribution
For each node expansion in the A* search the cost of the travel is computed considering AUV speed, fuel and corridor lenght.

Niu \etal~\cite{Niu2018Energy} present an energy efficient path planning for USVs considering sea current data;
They use a combination of Voronoi diagram, Visibility Graph, Dijkstra search and energy consuption function for determination of the path.
For each Voronoi segment its determined a energy consumption weight calculated based on \USV relative speed, the sea current speed, the drag force the \USV experiences, and the travel duration.
The predicted sea current speed is based on samples of the Tidetech Ltd, 2016. " Tidetech Ltd, Currents sample [Online]. https://www.tidetech.org/data. (Accessed 12 December 2016)".
They present simulations of \USV path planning in the Singapore Strait and Croatian islands and compare the simulation results to fifteen real-world trial on the same regions.

Usually, for \USV, there is a limited energy and saving energy allow more complex and demanding missions.
\USV energy-aware path planning studies usually are based on the fact that sea current imply higher level of energy cost on trnaspacing such waters.
For example, in Niu \etal~\cite{Niu2018Energy} they present an energy efficient path planning for USVs considering sea current data;
They use a combination of Voronoi diagram, Visibility Graph, Dijkstra search and energy consuption function for determination of the path.
For each Voronoi segment its determined a energy consumption weight calculated based on \USV relative speed, the sea current speed, the drag force the \USV experiences, and the travel duration.
The predicted sea current speed is based on samples of the Tidetech Ltd, 2016. " Tidetech Ltd, Currents sample [Online]. https://www.tidetech.org/data. (Accessed 12 December 2016)".
They present simulations of \USV path planning in the Singapore Strait and Croatian islands and compare the simulation results to fifteen real-world trial on the same regions.
Comparisons between the energy-aware path in comparison to the shortest path indicate increase on energy saving between 1.27% and 52.84%. 
More energy saving was found on situation with favourable sea current direction and low speed.
